For this assignment I have tried to re-create the \#glm() assignment
from two weeks ago using bayesien tools. I did not include the Male vs
Female differences, because I was not able to find a way to combine
continuous and discrete variables that did not break everything.

``` r
#Packages Used ----
library(dplyr)
library(R2jags)
library(emdbook)
library(dotwhisker)
library(emmeans)
```

I removed unnecessary columns from the data because the model was
complaining a lot when I left them as is. I have re-analyzed the data
using the frequentest approach below.

``` r
# Data and Frequentest model results ----
Plot_ready <- read.csv('Cor_data.csv')

Plot_ready <- Plot_ready %>% 
  select(-X, -TIME_PERIOD)
  

summary(glm(new_HIV~poly(M_to_C, 2),Plot_ready,family=gaussian(link = "identity")))
```

    ## 
    ## Call:
    ## glm(formula = new_HIV ~ poly(M_to_C, 2), family = gaussian(link = "identity"), 
    ##     data = Plot_ready)

To create the model on the .bug file I regenerated the polynomial
prediction. Since the rate of transmission from mother to child is per
100, I chose 50 as the mean and left the precision wide open. I was not
too sure what would be more appropriate. I was unclear and sort of still
am on whether the numbers within \#dnorm() are the values of that
parameter or the values w.r.t. to the response variable. I tried several
different numbers large and small and the RHat and n.eff did not change
much, so I was not sure how one evaluates the quality of one model over
the other. In the end i just stuck to my original assumptions as stated
below.

I kept the distributions as normal primarily because that was what I
assumed when I created the GLM about this dataset. I did try different
distribution, but several of them particularly the uniform and logistic
for some other types of data made the model complain a lot. I was not
too clear how to interpret the errors for non-continuous data.

I ran the model with JAGS and plotted the \#dotwhisker plot. Clearly the
numbers donâ€™t match up well to the frequentest numbers from the start of
this exercise. Perhaps my assumptions were too small? For a polynomial
model like this one, I do wonder how one goes about plotting this the
way the \#geom\_smooth() plots it to the dataset.

I am tempted to go back and change the priors, but I think that defeats
the purpose of them being priors. If that is the case, I wonder what one
is meant to do at this point. How can I improve upon this to make it
more meaningful to my dataset. In this particular example I did not
include other predictor variable, I suspect the number may be more fluid
if there was more of those as well.
