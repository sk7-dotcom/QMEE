# All QMEE Winter 2021 Assignments

Assignment#1 Prompt:

Choose a data set that might be fun for you to explore for examples in this class (and possibly for the class project). Acquire the data (or make a plan to acquire it), and add a paragraph to the README.md file in your course repo describing it. Please give us some context for the data and describe the biological questions you would hope to answer (if you also want to translate your biological questions into statistical questions that’s fine, but you should always start by framing the biological questions; the translation from biological to statistical questions is one of the hardest parts of data analysis).

Input some piece of this data (use some public data set if your real data set is not quickly available) into R, and do a substantive calculation using the data. You should upload a text file or spreadsheet, and an R script that reads it and does the calculation. You should confirm that these work by running them from beginning to end in a clean R session (in RStudio you can “Restart R”, then “Run All” from the “Run” icon above the script window) before submitting by email.

# World Health Organization: Worldwide data on Infant Mortalitiy from 1962 to 2020.

Biological question:

Considering the vast differences in climate, infectious diseases and healthcare facilities in North and South America I hypothesized that the infant mortality rate in South America would be significantly higher then in North America. I studied this here briefly looking at the World Health Organization data on this subject to understand whether there is a difference and how this statistic had changed since the 1950s.  

From this analysis, it would suggest the deaths per 1000 live births has fallen drastically since the 1950s across both continents. Although there was a vast disparity in infant mortality from the 1960s to around 2010, the numbers have become more even across the two continents since.
